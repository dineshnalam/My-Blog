# Python's PIP package manager

## Introduction

### What is a package manager?

A package manager is a collection of tools that are used to simplify the process of installing, updating, and uninstalling packages.

### But what is a package...?

A package in Python is a group of modules. What do these modules have? Modules contain a collection of "functions" or "variables." A group of similar modules is called a "package."

When a module is required in a program, you can use it by importing the package it is located in.

## Alas, the PIP!

PIP is a package manager used to automate the process of managing packages.

### Installation

The PIP package manager comes pre-installed with your latest version of Python. If, for some reason, it's not installed, use the following command to install the pip at its simplest:

```python
python -m ensurepip
```

This will simply install the PIP if it's not already installed.

To upgrade its version, you can run the following at the command prompt:

```python
py -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

or

```python
 py -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Environment Variables

To use the commands pre-built into "pip" in your Windows system, add the installation path to your environment variables.

Step 1: Search "Environment Variables" in your Windows search and go to "Edit the system Environment Variables."

Step 2: Click on "Environment Variables" and go to "System Variables."

Step 3: Click on "New", name the variable "pip" and give the variable value as the folder where the pip files are located. In my case, they are located at

C:\\Users\\Dinesh Nalam\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\\Lib\\site-packages\\pip

Step 4: Click on "OK."

To make sure that "PIP" is installed and working, run the following in the command prompt:

```python
pip --version
```

This checks whether the "pip" is working properly and displays the version that is currently installed in the system.

### Usage

To use the PIP, you can use the format to install your desired Python package.

```python
pip install <package name>
```

Example: To install a Python package called Numpy, run the following:

```python
pip install numpy
```

## **Conclusion**

You can use PIP to automate the process of installing and managing your python packages easily.

That's all for now! Hopefully, you learned something new.
